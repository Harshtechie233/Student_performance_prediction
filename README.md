Student Performance Prediction
Overview
This project explores the use of machine learning, specifically linear regression, to predict student performance based on key academic factors. The model leverages features such as study hours, attendance percentage, and past scores to forecast exam scores, providing actionable insights for educators and stakeholders to identify at-risk students and implement timely interventions.

Key Features
Dataset: 1000 observations with key features: Study Hours, Attendance, and Past Scores.
Model: Linear Regression for interpretable and effective prediction.
Performance Metrics:
Mean Absolute Error (MAE): 2.62
Mean Squared Error (MSE): 11.36
Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE): 3.37
R² Score: 0.92
Project Workflow
Data Preprocessing:

Handling missing values.
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) using pair plots and correlation heatmaps.
Feature scaling and outlier detection.
Model Training:

Split the dataset into training and testing sets.
Train a linear regression model using scikit-learn.
Evaluation:

Evaluate performance using metrics (MAE, MSE, RMSE, R²).
Visualize actual vs. predicted exam scores using scatter plots.
Results and Analysis:

High predictive performance with R² of 0.92.
Insights into key predictors: Study Hours and Past Scores were the most influential features.
Installation and Setup
To replicate this project, follow these steps:

Clone the Repository:

bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/your-username/student-performance-prediction.git  
cd student-performance-prediction  
Install Dependencies:
Ensure Python 3.8+ is installed. Install the required libraries using pip:

bash
Copy code
pip install -r requirements.txt  
Run the Code:
Open the Jupyter Notebook student_performance_prediction.ipynb to explore the code and results.

Dataset
The dataset includes 1000 rows with the following features:

Study_Hours: Time spent studying (in hours).
Attendance: Attendance percentage.
Past_Scores: Average of previous exam scores.
Exam_Scores: Target variable (actual exam score).
Note: The dataset used for this project is included as student_data.csv.

Performance Metrics
MAE: Measures average absolute error between predictions and actual values (2.62).
MSE: Penalizes larger errors by squaring them (11.36).
RMSE: Measures error in the same units as the target variable (3.37).
R² Score: Explains 92% of the variance in the target variable.
Future Improvements
Add additional features such as participation in extracurricular activities and socioeconomic factors.
Experiment with non-linear models (e.g., Decision Trees, Random Forests).
Validate the model on larger and more diverse datasets.
